# CWRU Class Selection

Small python script to enroll in classes using Selenium Webdriver python API and Google Chrome

THIS IS NOT TESTED YET, DO NOT DEPEND ON THIS AS OF NOW. 

## How to use it:

1. Make sure to install the following pip3      packages:
- pyyaml
- selenium

2. Install Google Chrome and the corresponding selenium driver. 

3. Configure the script with the `config.yaml` file

4. ???
5. profit (or your classes)


## Future Features (Maybe):
- Ability to prioritize which classes to select first.
- Run in multiple windows in order to send more requests at once (not sure if this would actually work).
